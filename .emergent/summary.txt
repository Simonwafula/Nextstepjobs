The previous AI engineer successfully bootstrapped a career advising tool from scratch, demonstrating an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach. Initial engagement involved clarifying product requirements, leading to the construction of a core MVP with user profile management, AI-powered job analysis, career advice, and market insights, primarily focusing on user-pasted job descriptions. A critical aspect was the integration of OpenAI via a verified playbook, highlighting adherence to secure API key handling protocols.

Following the MVP's successful backend testing, the engineer promptly addressed a new user request: implementing an anonymous search feature, which was also backend-tested. The subsequent phase heavily focused on security, specifically preventing  file leakage to GitHub. This involved updating , removing tracked  files from Git, and creating  templates. Critically, a security audit revealed the OpenAI API key had been exposed in Git history, necessitating immediate revocation and a full history scrub, which is the current ongoing task. The engineer consistently communicated progress, sought clarification, and addressed security vulnerabilities diligently.

<product_requirements>
The product is an AI-powered career advising tool designed to assist students, university students, graduates, and professionals. Its core purpose is to analyze job postings and provide comprehensive insights on job requirements, including academic qualifications, job titles, and company recommendations. It also aims to offer general career advice and insights into job market trends.

So far, the implemented solution includes:
1.  **User Profile System**: Allows users to create detailed profiles with education, skills, and experience, stored securely in MongoDB.
2.  **AI-Powered Job Analysis**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o to analyze pasted job descriptions, providing match scores, extracting requirements, responsibilities, and growth potential, and generating personalized recommendations.
3.  **Career Advice Engine**: Offers personalized AI guidance based on user profiles and intelligently answers career-related questions.
4.  **Market Insights**: Provides information on job market trends for specific fields and industry outlook.
5.  **Anonymous Career Search**: An open search function allowing users to get instant career guidance (general advice, career paths, skills development, industry insights) without account creation.
6.  **Trending Topics Section**: Displays currently in-demand careers, popular questions, and industry opportunities.
7.  **User Experience**: Features a responsive, clean, and functional interface with a dashboard, step-by-step guidance, and professional aesthetics.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines all API endpoints, handles business logic, interacts with MongoDB, and integrates with the OpenAI API.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial implementation included endpoints for user profile CRUD operations, AI-powered job analysis, and career advice.
        -   Recently updated to add  (anonymous search) and  endpoints, leveraging OpenAI for search query processing and generating trending content.
        -   Includes CORS middleware configuration.
        -   Uses  for OpenAI API calls.
        -   MongoDB interactions use  (async driver) and UUIDs for IDs.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that renders the user interface. It manages application state, handles user input, makes API calls to the backend, and displays data.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial implementation set up the UI for user profiles, job analysis input, and displaying AI-generated career advice and market insights.
        -   Significantly modified to incorporate the anonymous search functionality, including the search input form, type selection, search results display, and trending topics grid.
        -   Handles calls to the backend's  and  endpoints.
        -   Manages UI elements, including professional gradient backgrounds and animations using Tailwind CSS.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains the main application-specific CSS styles, likely leveraging Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom styles for specific components.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to support the new anonymous search UI, including styling for the search bar, topic buttons, and results display, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Store environment-specific variables like , , and . These are critical for connecting services and external APIs.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  was added to . Both files were previously tracked by Git, but have been explicitly removed from Git tracking and added to .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore, preventing sensitive data or build artifacts from being committed to the repository.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to explicitly include patterns like , , , etc., to ensure all environment variable files are ignored.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides project documentation, setup instructions, and critical information for developers.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include comprehensive environment setup instructions and security warnings regarding API keys and  files.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Acts as a testing log and protocol document for interaction with testing sub-agents.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated with details of backend and (intended) frontend tests, including their summaries and results.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the Git history cleanup to remove all instances of the exposed OpenAI API key.
-   Perform frontend testing of the entire application, including the newly implemented anonymous search functionality.
-   Consider future integration with real-time job APIs (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn) as originally discussed.

<current_work>
The application is currently a functional AI-powered career advising tool. The initial MVP, covering user profile management, AI-powered job description analysis, personalized career recommendations, and market insights, has been successfully implemented and its backend APIs are fully tested and working.

A significant enhancement, the anonymous search function, has also been integrated. This feature allows users to receive instant career guidance and explore trending topics without needing to create a profile. The backend endpoints for this functionality ( and ) have been successfully implemented and tested.

The most immediate work being addressed is a critical security concern: the user's OpenAI API key was found to be exposed in the Git history. The  files are now properly ignored by Git, and example templates () have been created. However, the API key remains in the repository's commit history. The current task involves performing a comprehensive security scan to identify any other sensitive data like database passwords (which were confirmed to be safe as they were default localhost connections without passwords) and then initiating a Git history rewrite (WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch...) to permanently expunge the exposed API key from the repository's commit history. This process is currently underway, with a backup branch being created before the history rewrite begins.
